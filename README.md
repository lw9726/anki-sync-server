[Anki][] is a powerful open source flashcard application, which helps you
quickly and easily memorize facts over the long term utilizing a spaced
repetition algorithm. Anki's main form is a desktop application (for Windows,
Linux and macOS) which can sync to a web version (AnkiWeb) and mobile
versions for Android and iOS.

This is a personal Anki server, which you can sync against instead of
AnkiWeb.
